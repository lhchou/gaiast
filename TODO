Things that you could improve:
-add the possibility to print out the output function above the upper pressure and below the lower pressure.
-allow to choose different models for each isotherm of the mixture.
-would be nice if we could comment lines on the input files. Actually the program breaks.
-add the possiblity to avoid displaying the picture (by adding a yes/no option in the input)
-It would be helpfully that the output png file would include the name of the models used during the fitting phase. In this way you can run several models of the same mixture and to obtain different files (they do not re-write each other).
-same with output data files. (these two points should be implemented by each user in its own script)
